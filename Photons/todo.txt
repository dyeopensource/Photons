Review:
- Check logging / output... Errors should be logged and also displayed
- implement remaining tests for all public methods of the classes

Feature:
- Implement keyboard check (to be able to interrupt the long running import operation without kill)
- Implement option: check consistency (no files in subdirectories, which are not in the database, length and hash match) 
- Implement media timestamp information (EXIF) - storage is implemented, calculation pending
	- JPG (Canon camera photo, also smartphone)
	- MPG (Sony handycam video)
	- MOV (Canon camera video)
	- M2T(?) (AVCHD from Sony handycam)
	- ?
- implement UI for
	a. deletion
	b. (un)assignemnt of files and groups (will be important when calendar event will be imported)
- Import events from google calendar. This contains events on which photos and videos were made. -> Media description/album title candidate.
	- This implies database changes, because events have a start and end interval (also location).
		Events will be special types of groups (additional data assigned with a group).
	My photo/video calendar:

Possible improvements:
- Apply to sound files
- Could be used to backup every kind of data - in this case restore could be an interesting task + duplicate finding

Tests:

- create integration test with all possible real scenarios (testdata, folder structure, database check) - including database and import checks described bellow

- check for test (maintenance) tools

Create tests for the project:
- have sample Canon memory card copy with every possible kind of 
	- photos and 
	- videos
	- also sound files
- have sample Sony memory stick copy with every possible kind of
	- photos,
	- SD and
	- HD videos,
	- including wide screen settings also, maybe captured sound if possible
- have sample Samsung memory card copy with all kinds of possible media:
	- photo
	- video
	- sound
- have sample DM memory card copy with every possible kind of media:
	- photo
	- video
	- sound
- have sample folder/files from a smartphone

- Database should be tested:
	- created if does not exist
	- opened if current version
	- opened if not current version + check migration
- Import should be tested:
	- simple file not in database
	- file with no access rights
	- not existing file (is it possible?)
	- every kind of links (shortcuts) - to avoid looping
	- file with different name, different content
	- file with same content, different name
	- file with same name, different path, same content
	- check if filer paths are inserted correctly as groups - also check file-group assignments

- Check not only the actions but also logging
