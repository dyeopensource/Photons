Implement FileInfoDatabase: should do similar thing than DatabaseUtil, but rather fileinfo specific.
Should not be static, default filename should be fileinfo.sqlite

Errors should be logged, not only displayed

Tests:

- check for test (maintenance) tools

Create tests for the project:
- have sample Canon memory card copy with every possible kind of 
	- photos and 
	- videos
- have sample Sony memory stick copy with every possible kind of
	- photos,
	- SD and
	- HD videos,
	- including wide screen settings also, maybe captured sound if possible
- Database should be tested:
	- created if does not exist
	- opened if current version
	- opened if not current version + check migration
- Import should be tested:
	- simple file not in database
	- file with no access rights
	- not existing file (is it possible?)
	- every kind of links (shortcuts) - to avoid looping
	- file with different name, different content
	- file with same content, different name
	- file with same name, different path, same content
- Check not only the actions but also logging
